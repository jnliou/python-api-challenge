# python-api-challenge - WeatherPy and VacationPy

This repository contains code for the Python API Challenge, which consists of two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy. In this project, we analyze weather data from various cities around the world and visualize the relationships between weather variables and latitude. We also use the Geoapify API to plan future vacations based on desired weather conditions.

# What is included in this folder?
WeatherPy.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for Part 1 of the project, which focuses on visualizing weather variables and latitude.
VacationPy.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for Part 2 of the project, which involves planning future vacations using weather data.
api_keys.py: Python file (ignored by Git) where the API keys for the OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify APIs should be stored.
.gitignore: File specifying which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
Obtain API keys for the OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify APIs.
Open the api_keys.py file and replace OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY and GEOAPIFY_API_KEY with your respective API keys.
Open the Jupyter Notebook files (WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.
Run the cells in the notebooks to execute the code and generate the visualizations and analysis.
